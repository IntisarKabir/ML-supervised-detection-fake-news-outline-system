# ML-supervised-detection-fake-news-outline-system

I have successfully led and worked with a team of fellow students in achieving a business-grade (even applicable as an industry-grade) solution and state-of-the-art architecture in solving real world NLP (Natural Language Processing) problems like Spam Detection (using LSTM), Fake News Detection (using Autoencoder / LSTM and other techniques), Fraud Detection (of any sort using Autoencoder) and similar scenarios. Besides, I tried developing some Recommendation Systems. I spent countless hours in searching for and researching on various fields of modern technologies including Software Architectures and tools, Software Development principles and practices, software require Analysis, Networking, Cryptography, AI, IOT, ML, DL etc. Moreover, I have learned from (through seminars and classes), discussed with and tutored (on YouTube and online meets) many people both online and offline. I have started researching and writing papers (not yet published due to lack of time and funding) on numerous topics and projects.
