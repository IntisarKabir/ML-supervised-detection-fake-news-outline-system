# ML-supervised-detection-fake-news-outline-system

I led a team of fellow engineering students in 
building a high quality machine learning architecture
which can efficiently solve a wide range of supervised problems 
including Fake news detection

we utilized the powers of LSTM neutral networks, bayes theorem and Autoencoders
